Hello!

My name's Idan Hovav, and this is my solution for the Illumio coding challenge!

I spent a majority of my time designing my code and ensuring that it is readable, modularized, maintainable, and easy to build off of!

Efficiency-wise, I made a few notes about where future optimizations could be made, but sadly, I did not have enough time to do these optimizations.

Additionally, if I had more time, I would create more complicated tests. I think there were many more cases and specifically edge cases that I could have covered. And since I spent a bit of time creating the testing framework, I think adding more tests would be very easy.

Finally, I think making my code well-modularized and abstracting away the `ProtocolRules` from `Firewall` specifically allows for future optimizations in the data structure choice for `ProtocolRules.rules` and also allowed for the fixing of bugs to be very easy and quick.

If I had another hour to spend on this project, I would make more tests. If I had more time, I would research if there are better data structures to use for rule storage. Investing time now in making the rules interface would make changing the underlying data structure easy. Furthermore, another optimization is merging the approved IP Address ranges for a port. Again, this optimization is lower priority than making the code work and be readable, modularized, and maintainable.

I'd love to discuss the other decisions I made during this project! Hope you've enjoyed looking through my solution.

Finally finally, as for team preferences, I'm currently emailing with a few employees and can follow up in an email about my preferences once my conversations have concluded. 

Signing off with one minute and four seconds to spare, this has been Idan Hovav. Thank you and goodnight!
